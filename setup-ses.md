# Setup SES

## Objectives
- Set up your domain to receive email using Amazon SES
- Save the email in raw format to an Amazon S3 bucket. The raw format is readable by Kloud Konsole Webmail client directly.

## Steps
- [Signup for AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you haven't
- Register a domain, this guide assumes you use cloudflare to [manage your DNS](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019093151-Managing-DNS-records-in-Cloudflare), but it is not required, any DNS tool given by your domain provider will be fine too.
